              <h2> Interests </h2>
           <p> I have a wide variety of interests that range from traveling to sci-fi. I enjoy taking pictures of sunsets and plants. In general, I enjoy taking pictures.<br>
             A wise man once said, <strong>“Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second.”</strong> I enjoy watching sci-fi as well.
             One of my favorites is Doctor Who. I became acquainted with this very great show 3 years ago. It was like wildfire. One spark was all it took. <br>
            Besides sci-fi, I also am very fond with the idea of traveling some day. When I say some day, I mean far into the future. Going to places far-far away.
            I've never really been anywhere either than Mexico, Washington D.C and Arizona. That's why my need to travel is so grand. <br>
            Now, besides all of that - I also really enjoy technology. It's kind of ironic since at one point I was very terrified of computers. When I was 8,
            I used to have nightmares about them.
           </p>
            <h2> My Future</h2>
            <p> Though I honestly don't know what my future has in store for me, I know what I want. I hope to become a Software Engineer someday.
            And if I can't be one, I thoroughly hope I become some sort of engineer in technology. I won't stop til I've reached my goal. Though I 
            may not be a pro at coding <em>now</em>, I will eventually. Besides technology in my future, I wish to study abroad. I want to travel to
            places around the world like South Korea, Australia, Iceland, and France. I want to make an impact on our world, whether it be small.
            And though the process will be very difficult, I believe I can do it. With a bit of motivation, and help from my peers I will get better.
            Eventually I will attain my goal and this when I know I have succeeded. <br>
            <strong>Until then, I will struggle until I overcome and thrive.</strong> </p>
