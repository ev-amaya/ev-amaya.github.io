           <h2> Hello, World!</h2>
           <p> 1/22/16 </p>
           <p> The date at the top is actually kind of invalid. I did not start this class until the next week.
             I have started this blog to keep track of what I accomplish and what I learn during my time
            with the CS50 program! Pretty cool right? I hope that I eventually master the basics of programming and 
            coding because (hopefully) it is my future.</p>
            <p>I am taking ACS because it seems very interesting and it
            captured my attention. At first I hesitated between a different elective, but in the end
            I am greatful that I chose ACS. Though it differs between all of our elective classes because
            of the extensive work and effort you have to put into it, I believe that it is worth 
            every ounce of energy.. <b>Even if I do stay up at night and cry because I suddenly have so
            much responsibility.</b>
           </p>
           <p> What I hope to get out of this class is superiority over my peers. 'Nuff said.</p>
           <p> Until my next post,</p>
            <p> Evelyn.</p>
